9/4/12:
"from_Bildr" working fine, with speeds (unitless) from 0.001 to 1
"Stepper_07" seems to be working, but not so sure on Go Home, find reed switch, and from home go so many steps code.
"Stepper_08": not working yet, trying to incorp takePic subroutine
"Take_pic_03": not working yet, trying to incorp smart polling for focus and shutter pins.



High level:

Go Home = yes
	using go home direction and speed, run until switch closes
	then go in direction of dirFromHome the appropriate steps

then, set direction according to stepDir and go on with the code




takePic

if enough time between pictures has occurred:
	set the focus pin to high

if the focus pin is high, see if enough time has passed to set the shutter pin high

delay for (2 seconds - (focusdelay + shutterdelay))
toggle focusPin
delay for focusdelay
toggle shutterPin
delay for shutterdelay
toggle focusPin
toggle shutterPin


takePic2
every Interval seconds, toggle focusPin

boolean is true, toggle boolean for
